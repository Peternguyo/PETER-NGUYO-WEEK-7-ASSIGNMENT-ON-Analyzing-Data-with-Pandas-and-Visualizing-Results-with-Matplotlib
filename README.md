# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas & Matplotlib

## 📝 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Pandas** for data analysis and **Matplotlib** for visualizing insights from a real-world dataset. The aim was to:
- Load and explore a dataset using pandas
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Visualize results using Matplotlib
- Derive useful business insights

## 📁 Dataset

**Name:** [Kaggle - Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data)  
**Description:** The dataset contains historical sales data including columns such as Order Date, Product, Quantity Ordered, and Revenue. It is suitable for practicing data manipulation, grouping, and visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🧪 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Data Analysis
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset with Pandas
- Computed descriptive statistics (`.describe()`)
- Grouped sales data by `Product` and `Region`
- Identified top-selling products and most profitable regions
- Detected any data issues (e.g., missing or invalid entries)

### 📊 Visualizations
1. **Line Chart** – Sales trends over time
2. **Bar Chart** – Total revenue by product
3. **Histogram** – Distribution of quantity ordered
4. **Scatter Plot** – Revenue vs. quantity sold

All visualizations were saved as `.png` files using `plt.savefig()` before displaying with `plt.show()`.
